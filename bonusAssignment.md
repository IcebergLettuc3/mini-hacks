##Assignment: Implementing Sorting Functionality in React with SortPage.js

Objective: Enhance your React application's SortPage.js to include sorting functionality for movie data. You will create a feature that allows users to sort movies alphabetically in both ascending (A-Z) and descending (Z-A) order.

##Use the `utils/MovieData.json` file for this exercise

##Requirements:


##Implement Sorting Buttons:
Ensure two buttons are correctly implemented: one for sorting movies from A to Z and another for sorting from Z to A.
These buttons should call sortMoviesAsc and sortMoviesDesc functions, respectively.

##Sorting Functions:
Write the logic for sortMoviesAsc to sort the movies in ascending order by title.
Write the logic for sortMoviesDesc to sort the movies in descending order by title.
Ensure the movie data is sorted without affecting the original data structure (hint: use the spread operator [...] to create a copy of the movies array).

##Render Sorted Movies:
Use the map function to render the sorted movies. Each movie should display its title, poster, and a brief overview.
Ensure the movies are re-rendered correctly whenever the sort order changes.

##Styling (Optional):
Use TailwindCSS to style the sorting buttons and the movie grid.
Enhance the UI to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.

##Deliverables:

Updated SortPage.js with functional A-Z and Z-A sorting buttons.
Correct implementation of sortMoviesAsc and sortMoviesDesc functions.
The movie grid should update to reflect the current sort order when either button is clicked.

This assignment will help you understand state management in React, array manipulation using sort functions, and event handling. Itâ€™s a practical exercise to strengthen your React and JavaScript skills.
